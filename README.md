# Dot Files
My personal config files tweaked by years of use and experience.

##Â Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:jkrcma/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

Install script reads `filelist.txt` and copies (interactively) particular files with prepended dot to your home directory.

## Custom changes
Take advantage of GitHub's repository fork feature to keep track of them.
After making your own changes, simply run `update.sh` to add files to your repository then commit and push.
